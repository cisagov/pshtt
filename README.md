`pshtt` (*"pushed"*) is a tool to scan domains for HTTPS best
practices. It saves its results to a CSV (or JSON) file.

`pshtt` was developed to *push* organizations â€” especially large ones
like the US Federal Government :us: â€” to adopt HTTPS across the
enterprise. Federal agencies must comply with
[M-15-13](https://https.cio.gov), a 2015 memorandum from the White
House Office of Management and Budget, and [BOD
18-01](https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/18-01/), a 2017 directive from the
Department of Homeland Security, which require federal agencies to
enforce HTTPS on their public web services. Much has been done, but
there's [more yet to
do](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/01/04/tracking-the-us-governments-progress-on-moving-https/).

`pshtt` is a collaboration between the Cyber and Infrastructure
Security Agency's [National Cybersecurity Assessments and Technical
Services (NCATS) team](https://github.com/cisagov) and [the General
Service Administration's 18F team](https://18f.gsa.gov), with
[contributions from NASA, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and
various non-governmental
organizations](https://github.com/cisagov/pshtt/graphs/contributors).

## Getting started ##

`pshtt` can be installed as a module, or run directly from the
repository.

### Installed as a module ###

`pshtt` can be installed directly via pip:

```console
pip install pshtt
```

It can then be run directly:

```console
pshtt example.com [options]
```

### Running directly ###

To run the tool locally from the repository, without installing, first
install the requirements:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run it as a module via `python -m`:

```console
python -m pshtt.cli example.com [options]
```

### Usage and examples ###

```console
pshtt [options] DOMAIN...
pshtt [options] INPUT

pshtt dhs.gov
pshtt --output=homeland.csv --debug dhs.gov us-cert.gov usss.gov
pshtt --sorted current-federal.csv
```

Note: if INPUT ends with `.csv`, domains will be read from the first
column of the CSV. CSV output will always be written to disk (unless
--json is specified), defaulting to `results.csv`.

#### Options ####

```console
  -h --help                     Show this message.
  -s --sorted                   Sort output by domain, A-Z.
  -o --output=OUTFILE           Name output file. (Defaults to "results".)
  -j --json                     Get results in JSON. (Defaults to CSV.)
  -m --markdown                 Get results in Markdown. (Defaults to CSV.)
  -d --debug                    Print debug output.
  -u --user-agent=AGENT         Override user agent.
  -t --timeout=TIMEOUT          Override timeout (in seconds).
  -c --cache-third-parties=DIR  Cache third party data, and what directory to cache it in.
  -f --ca-file=PATH             Specify custom CA bundle (PEM format)
```

##### Using your own CA bundle #####

By default, `pshtt` relies on the root CAs that are trusted in the
[Mozilla root
store](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt).
If you work behind a corporate proxy or have your own certificates that
aren't publicly trusted, you can specify your own CA bundle:

```console
pshtt --ca-file=/etc/ssl/ca.pem server.internal-location.gov
```

## What's checked? ##

A domain is checked on its four endpoints:

- `http://`
- `http://www`
- `https://`
- `https://www`

### Domain and redirect info ###

The following values are returned in `results.csv`:

- `Domain` - The domain you're scanning!
- `Base Domain` - The base domain of `Domain`. For example, for a
  Domain of `sub.example.com`, the Base Domain will be
  `example.com`. Usually this is the second-level domain, but `pshtt`
  will download and factor in the [Public Suffix
  List](https://publicsuffix.org) when calculating the base
  domain. (To cache the Public Suffix List, use `--suffix-cache` as
  documented above.)
- `Canonical URL` - One of the four endpoints described above; a
  judgment call based on the observed redirect logic of the domain.
- `Live` - The domain is "live" if any endpoint is live.
- `HTTPS Live` - The domain is "HTTPS live" if any HTTPS endpoint is
  live.
- `HTTPS Full Connection` - The domain is "fully connected" if any
  HTTPS endpoint is fully connected.  A "fully connected" HTTPS
  endpoint is one with which pshtt could make a full TLS connection.
- `HTTPS Client Auth Required` - A domain requires client
  authentication if *any* HTTPS endpoint requires it for a full TLS
  connection.
- `Redirect` - The domain is a "redirect domain" if at least one
  endpoint is a redirect, and all endpoints are either redirects or
  down.
- `Redirect to` - If a domain is a "redirect domain", where does it
  redirect to?

### Landing on HTTPS ###

- `Valid HTTPS` - A domain has "valid HTTPS" if it responds on port
  443 at the hostname in its Canonical URL with an unexpired valid
  certificate for the hostname. This can be true even if the Canonical
  URL uses HTTP.
- `HTTPS Publicly Trusted` - A domain is "publicly trusted" if its
  canonical endpoint has a publicly trusted certificate.
- `HTTPS Custom Truststore Trusted` - A domain is "custom truststore
  trusted" if its canonical endpoint has a certificate that is trusted
  by the custom truststore.
- `Defaults to HTTPS` - A domain "defaults to HTTPS" if its canonical
  endpoint uses HTTPS.
- `Downgrades HTTPS` - A domain "downgrades HTTPS" if HTTPS is
  supported in some way, but its canonical HTTPS endpoint immediately
  redirects internally to HTTP.
- `Strictly Forces HTTPS` - This is different than whether a domain
  "defaults" to HTTPS. A domain "Strictly Forces HTTPS" if one of the
  HTTPS endpoints is "live", and if both HTTP endpoints are either
  down or redirect immediately to any HTTPS URI. An HTTP redirect can
  go to HTTPS on another domain, as long as it's immediate. (A domain
  with an invalid cert can still be enforcing HTTPS.)

### Common errors ###

- `HTTPS Bad Chain` - A domain has a bad chain if either HTTPS
  endpoint contains a bad chain.
- `HTTPS Bad Hostname` - A domain has a bad hostname if either HTTPS
  endpoint fails hostname validation.
- `HTTPS Expired Cert` - A domain has an expired certificate if either
  HTTPS endpoint has an expired certificate.
- `HTTPS Self-Signed Cert` - A domain has a self-signed certificate if
  either HTTPS endpoint has a self-signed certificate.
- `HTTPS Probably Missing Intermediate Cert` - A domain is "probably
  missing intermediate certificate" if the canonical HTTPS endpoint is
  probably missing an intermediate certificate.

### HSTS ###

- `HSTS` - A domain has HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled if its
  canonical HTTPS endpoint has HSTS enabled.
- `HSTS Header` - This field provides a domain's HSTS header at its
  canonical endpoint.
- `HSTS Max Age` - A domain's HSTS max-age is its canonical endpoint's
  max-age.
- `HSTS Entire Domain` - A domain has HSTS enabled for the entire
  domain if its **root HTTPS endpoint** (*not the canonical HTTPS
  endpoint*) has HSTS enabled and uses the HSTS `includeSubDomains`
  flag.
- `HSTS Preload Ready` - A domain is HSTS "preload ready" if its
  **root HTTPS endpoint** (*not the canonical HTTPS endpoint*) has
  HSTS enabled, has a max-age of at least 18 weeks, and uses the
  `includeSubDomains` and `preload` flag.
- `HSTS Preload Pending` - A domain is "preload pending" when it
  appears in the [Chrome preload pending
  list](https://hstspreload.org/api/v2/pending) with the
  `include_subdomains` flag equal to `true`.  The intent of `pshtt` is
  to make sure that the user is *fully* protected, so it only counts
  domains as HSTS preloaded if they are *fully* HSTS preloaded
  (meaning that all subdomains are included as well).
- `HSTS Preloaded` - A domain is HSTS preloaded if its domain name
  appears in the [Chrome preload
  list](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/net/+/master/http/transport_security_state_static.json)
  with the `include_subdomains` flag equal to `true`, regardless of
  what header is present on any endpoint.  The intent of `pshtt` is to
  make sure that the user is *fully* protected, so it only counts
  domains as HSTS preloaded if they are *fully* HSTS preloaded
  (meaning that all subdomains are included as well).
- `Base Domain HSTS Preloaded` - A domain's base domain is HSTS
  preloaded if its base domain appears in the [Chrome preload
  list](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/net/+/master/http/transport_security_state_static.json)
  with the `include_subdomains` flag equal to `true`. This is subtly
  different from `HSTS Entire Domain`, which inspects headers on the
  base domain to see if HSTS is set correctly to encompass the entire
  zone.

### Scoring ###

These three fields use the previous results to come to high-level
conclusions about a domain's behavior.

- `Domain Supports HTTPS` - A domain 'Supports HTTPS' when it doesn't
  downgrade and has valid HTTPS, or when it doesn't downgrade and has
  a bad chain but not a bad hostname (a bad hostname makes it clear
  the domain isn't actively attempting to support HTTPS, whereas an
  incomplete chain is just a mistake.). Domains with a bad chain
  "support" HTTPS but user-side errors can be expected.
- `Domain Enforces HTTPS` - A domain that 'Enforces HTTPS' must
  'Support HTTPS' and default to HTTPS. For websites (where `Redirect`
  is `false`) they are allowed to *eventually* redirect to an
  `https://` URI. For "redirect domains" (domains where the `Redirect`
  value is `true`) they must *immediately* redirect clients to an
  `https://` URI (even if that URI is on another domain) in order to
  be said to enforce HTTPS.
- `Domain Uses Strong HSTS` - A domain 'Uses Strong HSTS' when the
  max-age â‰¥ 31536000.

### General information ###

- `IP` - The IP for the domain.
- `Server Header` - The server header from the response for the
  domain.
- `Server Version` - The server version, as extracted from the server
  header.
- `HTTPS Cert Chain Length` - The certificate chain length for the
  canonical HTTPS endpoint.
- `Notes` - A field where free-form notes about the domain can be
  stored.

### Uncommon errors ###

- `Unknown Error` - A Boolean value indicating whether or not an
  unexpected exception was encountered when testing the domain.  The
  purpose of this field is to flag any odd websites for further
  debugging.

## Troubleshooting ##

### DNS blackhole / DNS assist ###

One issue which can occur when running `pshtt`, particularly for
home/residential networks, with standard ISPs is the use of "DNS
Assist" features, a.k.a. "DNS Blackholes".

In these environments, you may see inconsistent results from `pshtt`
owing to the fact that your ISP is attempting to detect a request for
an unknown site without a DNS record and is redirecting you to a
search page for that site. This means that an endpoint which *should*
resolve as "not-alive", will instead resolve as "live", owing to the
detection of the live search result page.

If you would like to disable this "feature", several ISPs offer the
ability to opt out of this service, and maintain their own
instructions for doing so:

- [AT&T](http://www.att.net/dnserrorassist/about/srchTrm=Redirect%20Bin)
- [FIOS](https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/internet/fiosinternet/troubleshooting/network/questionsone/99147.htm)

## Who uses pshtt? ##

- The Freedom of the Press Foundation runs
  [securethe.news](https://securethe.news), a site that aims to "track
  and promote the adoption of HTTPS encryption by major news
  organizations' websites". [Secure the News is open
  source](https://securethe.news/blog/secure-news-open-source/).
- DHS issues [HTTPS Reports](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/01/06/open-source-collaboration-across-agencies-to-improve-https-deployment/)
  to federal executive branch agencies.
